# questgenanki

This is a fork of [Questgen.AI](https://github.com/ramsrigouthamg/Questgen.ai) with some underlying changes to the model and integration with [genanki](https://github.com/kerrickstaley/genanki) for generation of anki cards. This is mostly for personal use, so there's no easy installation at the moment, you should be able to get up to speed by skimming Questgen's documentation.

The main idea is to turn it into a CLI (Typer), and be able to pipe text into it, then (interactive?) creation of cards into decks. Still pondering what I want to do with this, since it's mostly for my non-fiction / blog reading to help with my memory.
