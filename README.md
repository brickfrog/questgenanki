# questgenanki

This is a fork of [Questgen.AI](https://github.com/ramsrigouthamg/Questgen.ai) with some underlying changes to the model and integration with [genanki](https://github.com/kerrickstaley/genanki) for generation of anki cards. This is mostly for personal use, so there's no easy installation at the moment, you should be able to get up to speed by skimming Questgen's documentation.
